# React Challenge

This is the React Challenge for Jobsity. The goal of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React.

## Techs

This project uses Redux for global state management, Jest + RTL for component testing and Storybook for visualizing UI components isolated (Which also helps testing). Forms were built using `react-hook-form` and transitions such as appearing reminders on the calendar and modal open/close were made using `framer-motion`. Also, I added TypeScript to improve the developer experience once the project got bigger.

To style the components, I've used Sass, along with CSS Vars. A Material Design'ish color palette was generated by using a "base" Hue Saturation value and, with the help of mixins, shades of the base color were created. Spacing helper classes were generated for margin and padding.

## How to deploy

- Run `npm install --force` | `yarn install --force` to install all dependencies. Force is needed because some deps are breaking with React v18
- Run `npm start` | `yarn run` to run the app locally.
- You can find the project running on `localhost:3000`.
